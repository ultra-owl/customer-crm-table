## 🌟 Overview

Handling large datasets is a common challenge in CRM and analytics platforms. Traditional table components often become slow, unresponsive, or memory-heavy when dealing with significant volumes of data.

This project takes a **performance-centric engineering approach** by combining:

- Custom virtual scrolling  
- Optimized rendering strategies  
- Lightweight UI design  
- Efficient search and filtering logic  

The result is a scalable, developer-friendly solution ideal for customer management systems, dashboards, and any application requiring high-volume, high-performance table rendering.

## 💡 Engineering Approach

### **1. Manual Virtual Scrolling**
A custom virtual-rendering system ensures full control over:
- Row calculations  
- Buffering strategy  
- Scroll tracking  
- DOM performance  

This results in consistently fast rendering regardless of dataset size.

### **2. Optimized Data Operations**
Filtering, searching, and sorting are optimized to avoid blocking or UI freezes:
- Minimal re-renders  
- Predictable performance  
- Smooth interaction even on massive datasets  

### **3. Minimalistic, Modular Codebase**
The code is intentionally kept simple and expressive:
- Easy to understand and extend  
- No heavy abstractions or dependencies  
- Suitable for production use and technical learning
